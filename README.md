# JavaFX-and-Chess
A simple chess API package with console-game level capabilities, tied into a JavaFX GUI. This started as practice for my upcoming CMSI 185 class, but took off as I found more interesting things to do with JavaFX.

Features:
- Move and turn checking to prevent illegal play
- History of moves
- Loading and saving of board states, turns, and history
- Togglable sounds
- No resources outside of built-in Java 8 libraries (aside from the 4 sounds)
